Binary classification of EEG motor imagery data using deep learning 
There are 3 CNN models(Tor2, Tor3,Tor4) proposed to classify motor imagery EEG data. We have compared them with traditional algorithms
for classification like LDA and SVM. Our models showed 65%(Tor3),66%(Tor4) and 68%(Tor2) of accuracy, while LDA and SVM showed 65% and 64% respectively. Tor2 model was based on the paper "Single-trial EEG classification of motor imagery using deep convolutional neural networks" by Tang and et.
