# EEGclassification
Binary classification of EEG motor imagery data using deep learning 
There are 3 CNN models(Tor 2, Tor 3,Tor 4) proposed to classify motor imagery EEG data. We have compared them with traditional algorithms
for classification like LDA and SVM. Our models showed 65%,66% and 68% of accuracy, while LDA and SVM showed 65% and 64% respectively.
